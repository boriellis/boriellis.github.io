[Allison Payne](https://allisonpayne.github.io) and I first designed and taught our course, titled [**Queer Ecologies**](https://allisonpayne.github.io/queerecologies), in spring 2023, and re-offered it in Spring 2024. This class was a seminar style undergraduate course designed to expand students' horizons, uplift queer perspectives in ecology, and build queer community. We're looking forward to re-offering the class in the future!
