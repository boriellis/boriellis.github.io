### Welcome!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Aspen Ellis - I'm a seabird conservation ecologist and a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My current research focuses on mitigation strategies for the impacts of offshore wind energy development to seabirds. This website is currently in development, stay tuned for updates!
